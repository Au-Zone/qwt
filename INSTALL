Introduction
============

Qwt uses qmake to build all its components and examples. 
qmake is part of a Qt distribution. 

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to 
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix "*.pro". 
Files that end with the suffix "*.pri" are included by the project 
files and contain definitions, that are common for several project files.

qwtconfig.pri/qwtbuild.pri are read by all project files of the Qwt package.
So the first step is to edit qwtconfig.pri/qwtbuild.pri to adjust it to your
needs.

MathML Extension
================

Qwt supports the MathML render engine from the Qt solutions package.

You need a release of qtmmlwidget >= 2.1.
Copy the files qtmmlwidget.[cpp|h] to textengines/mathml.

Documentation
==========================

Qwt includes a class documentation, that is available in various formats:

- Html files
- PDF document 
- Qt Compressed Help (*.qch ) for the Qt assistant or creator. 
  You can load it "Edit Preferences" -> "Documentation" -> "Add..."
- Man pages ( UNIX only )

Building Qwt
==========================

A) Unix 
--------

qmake
make
make install

If you have installed a shared library it's path has to be known to 
the run-time linker of your operating system. On Linux systems read
"man ldconfig" ( or google for it ). Another option is to use
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on some systems LIBPATH is used instead, on MacOSX
it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) environment variable.

If you only want to check the Qwt examples without installing something,
you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory 
of your local build. 

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake 
make


B) Win32/MSVC 
--------

Please read the qmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

F.e MSVC with nmake:
qmake qwt.pro
nmake

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
nmake

admin/msvc-qmake.bat helps users of Visual Studio users to
generate makefiles or project files (.dsp for MSVC-6.0 or vcproj for 
MSVC.NET) for Qwt.

To generate makefiles, type: "admin\msvc-qmake"
To generate project files, type: "admin\msvc-qmake vc"

When you have built a Qwt DLL you need to add the following
define to your compiler flags: QWT_DLL.

Windows doesn't like mixing of debug and release binaries. Most
of the problems with using the Qwt designer plugin are because
of trying to load a Qwt debug library into a designer release 
executable.


C) Win32/MinGW 
--------

Start a Shell, where Qt4 is initialized. ( F.e. with
"Programs->Qt by Trolltech ...->Qt 4.x.x Command Prompt" ).

qmake qwt.pro
make

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples this way:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
make
make install

When you have built a Qwt DLL you need to add QWT_DLL to your compiler 
flags. If you are using qmake for your own builds this done by adding 
the following line to your profile: "DEFINES += QWT_DLL".

Windows doesn't like mixing of debug and release binaries. Most
of the problems with using the Qwt designer plugin are because
of trying to load a Qwt debug library into a designer release 
executable.

D) MacOSX
--------

Well, the Mac is only another Unix system. So read the instructions in A).

In the recent Qt4 releases the default target of qmake is to generate
XCode project files instead of makefiles. So you might need to do the
following:

qmake -spec macx-g++
...

D) Qt Embedded
--------

I only tested Qwt with Qt Embedded in qvfb (Virtual Framebuffer Devivce)
Emulator on my Linux box. To build Qwt for the emulator was as simple as 
for a regular Unix build.

F) Symbian
--------

I never tried this platform myself.

Using Qwt
===========

For building a Qwt application with qmake it might be enough adding
"CONFIG += qwt" to your project file. This assignment will load 
all compiler/linker flags, that are required for building a Qwt
application into your Makefile. If it doesn't work check
where you have installed qwt.prf and read 
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qmake-advanced-usage.html#adding-new-configuration-features

If you don't use qmake you have to add the include path to find the Qwt 
headers to your compiler flags and the qwt library to your linker list.
Don't forget to add QWT_DLL to the compiler flags, when you work with a 
Qwt-DLLs on Windows.


Good luck !
